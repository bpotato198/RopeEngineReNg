# RopeEngineReNg

Very basic Rendering Engine that im working on, uses OpenGL with GLFW for Windowing

currently has:
  basic shape rendering
  colors

  The "ReNg" in the name stands for "Rendering Engine (said as Ngine)"

# How to build
1. install CMake and Clang (or GCC)
2. make sure you have GLFW and OpenGL
3. `git clone` this repo
4. type in the command line `cd RopeEngineReNg`
5. run this command `mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..`
6. run in `ropeenginereng/` catalog, `make` this should build it (if youre on Windows, you need to open it with Visual Studio and build it from Visual Studio AFAIK)
